### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

As far as challenges, just learning about the different controllers and storyboards and making sure everything connected properly was the main thing that I needed to focus hard on.

Along with this, working with the phone simulator is an adjustment too. Sometimes new changes that I had added wouldn't load (for instance, my loading screen picture did not work), but once I closed out the simulator and reloaded it, everything worked fine. 

It was cool to use and display an API on a mobile setting, and I'm looking forward to getting to learn more.
